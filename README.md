This is the first research group I followed of Information and Communication Engineering. As the knowledge I learned in the first and this half year is very basic, I have to learn from zero.

Hope I can work hard and learn a lot with the help of [Dr Yan](http://ices.cuc.edu.cn/2020/0509/c5332a170187/pagem.htm) and [Dr Lin](http://people.ucas.ac.cn/~lint) :D

## The first two weeks(2021.01.02 - 2021.01.15)

- learn about the basic knowledge
- the concept of the basic terms
