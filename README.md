# Streaming_media_technology
This is the first research group I followed of Information and Communication Engineering. As the knowledge I learned in the first and this half year is very basic, I have to learn from zero.

Hope I can work hard and learn a lot with the help of [Dr Yan](http://ices.cuc.edu.cn/2020/0509/c5332a170187/pagem.htm) and [Dr Lin](http://people.ucas.ac.cn/~lint) :D

## The third part (2021.01.11 - 2021.01.15)

PS : Maybe you find that some of the pictures can not be loaded, that's because Github can not load the file without the suffix name.     
To solve the problem, you can:

- close your proxy software for a short time.
- or download the Markdown File directly.
