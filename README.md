# Streaming_media_technology
This is the first research group I followed of Information and Communication Engineering. As the knowledge I learned in the first and this half year is very basic, I have to learn from zero.

Hope I can work hard and learn a lot with the help of [Dr Yan](http://ices.cuc.edu.cn/2020/0509/c5332a170187/pagem.htm) and [Dr Lin](http://people.ucas.ac.cn/~lint) :D

## LongTerm Plan One (Until 2020.03.01) -- Do survey & Set up the experimental platform

### The first part (2021.01.02 - 2021.01.07)

- Learn about the basic knowledge
- the concept of the basic terms

### The second part (2021.01.07 - 2021.01.10)

- Read the paper 《 Scalable-360°-Video-Stream-Delivery-Challenges-Solutions-and-Opportunities》
- Search for the content distribution technologies

### The third part (2021.01.11 - 2021.01.15)

- Research on existing 360° video projection technolodge.(plain)
- Learn about Mass Storage System. (plain)
- Learn about video codingtechnique. (plain)
- Read the paper 《IEEEMULTIMEDIA-VR CACHING SURVEY》

### The forth part (2021.01.16 - 2021.01.18)

- Search for papers related to edge caching for 360° video

### The fifth part (2021.01.19 - 2021.01.23)

- Read the paper《FoV-Aware Edge Caching for Adaptive 360◦ Video Streaming》
- pay attention to :
  1. what's the problem
  2. what's the model / method
  3. experience platform
  4. dataset and the evaluation index

### The Sixth part (2021.01.24 - 2021.01.28)

- Read the paper 《Flocking_based_Live_Streaming_of_360_degree_Video_Final_Version》
- Focus on algorithms and environments

PS : Maybe you find that some of the pictures can not be loaded, that's because Github can not load the file without the suffix name.     
To solve the problem, you can:

- close your proxy software for a short time.
- or download the Markdown File directly.
